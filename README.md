# DotType

[DotType MVC](https://github.com/dottype/dottype.mvc) is a semi-port of .Net Core MVC to TypeScript. Useful for people that come 
from strongly-type languages like c# and java, and have difficulties with existing javascript frameworks.

DotType MVC is a very fast, lighweight and simple server-side framework based on Node.js.

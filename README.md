# DotType MVC

DotType MVC is a semi-port of .Net Core MVC to TypeScript. Useful for people that come 
from strongly-type languages like c# and java, and have difficulties with existing javascript frameworks.

DotType MVC is a very fast, lighweight and simple server-side framework based on Node.js, written in TypeScript. 

## Installing
The DotType credo is simplicity. Everything that you need for install and run the framework is here.

1. Install [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   Nodejs will install [npm](package manager for javascript) - a package manager for javascript
2. Install TypeScript
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
